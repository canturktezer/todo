To-Do List App

The To-Do List App is a simple web application that allows you to create and manage a list of tasks or to-do items. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and removing tasks from the list.

Features:

Add a new task: Enter a task description in the input field and click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.
Mark task as completed: Click on a task to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough effect.
Remove task: Click the "Remove" button next to a task to remove it from the list. A confirmation modal will be displayed before the task is permanently deleted.

Technologies Used:

The To-Do List App is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure and elements of the web page.
CSS: Stylesheet language for defining the visual layout and appearance of the app.
JavaScript: Programming language for implementing the interactive functionality of the app.
Font Awesome: Library of scalable vector icons used for the checkmark and cross icons in the task buttons.

Usage:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Type a task description in the input field labeled "Add a new task...".
Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.
To mark a task as completed, click on the task text. The task will be displayed with a strikethrough effect.
To remove a task, click the "Remove" button (X icon) next to the task. A confirmation modal will appear. Click "Confirm" to delete the task or "Cancel" to close the modal.
The app automatically saves the tasks in the browser's local storage, so the tasks will persist even if you refresh or close the browser window.
